# EthioMart: Centralized Telegram-Based E-Commerce Hub

## Project Overview
EthioMart envisions becoming the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. With the increasing use of Telegram for business transactions, various independent e-commerce channels have emerged. However, this decentralization presents challenges for vendors and customers, such as managing multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication.

### Solution
EthioMart addresses these challenges by creating a single centralized platform that consolidates real-time data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels into one unified channel. This platform will:
- Provide a seamless experience for customers to explore and interact with multiple vendors in one place.
- Enhance vendor visibility by aggregating data from various channels.

## Project Focus: Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER)
A key component of this project involves fine-tuning a Language Model (LLM) for an Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. The NER system will extract critical business entities from text, images, and documents shared across these Telegram channels. These entities include:
- **Product Names**
- **Prices**
- **Locations**

### Data Usage
The extracted data will be used to populate EthioMart's centralized database, making it a comprehensive e-commerce hub that supports:
- Streamlined product discovery
- Accurate and real-time information for customers
- Better analytics for vendors

## Key Features
1. **Centralized Data Aggregation**:
   - Real-time consolidation of data from multiple Telegram e-commerce channels.

2. **Amharic Language Support**:
   - Tailored NLP solutions to process and understand Amharic language text.

3. **NER System**:
   - Extracts key business entities from shared content (text, images, and documents).

4. **Seamless User Experience**:
   - Unified interface for customers to explore products and interact with vendors.

## Technical Stack
- **Language Model**: Fine-tuned LLM for Amharic NER.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Tools for text, image, and document processing.
- **Database**: Centralized repository for extracted entities.
- **Integration**: APIs to fetch and update data in real-time.

## Benefits
- **For Customers**:
  - Simplified product discovery.
  - Enhanced convenience by interacting with multiple vendors in one channel.
- **For Vendors**:
  - Increased visibility and reach.
  - Insights from centralized analytics.
